        <h2>Chairman Message</h2>
        <p>Assalam-o-Alaikum</p><br>
        <p>Who is that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiple it for him many times over? (Surat Baqara,Verses 245) </p><br>
        <p>It should be noted that Allah, who is in need if no one and nothingm instells upon his men to give Qarz-e-Hasana because it is in man's nature to be frugal whilst spending his wealth.Allah speaks about qarz because it is returned and Allah promise that He will return the goodly loan by 70 folds. Allah conveys his message to the Muslim ummah through the Holy Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) prompting Muslims to spend their wealthin a certain way . He says,Oh children of Adam! Trust me with your wealth. If you do so, no fire,flood or thives will be able to rob you off your money. </p><br>
        <p>Allhamdollilah, Allah has accorded our Organizationwith the highest favor by sending those in need. The purpose of sending this message too you is so that you not only spreadd this message to others but also play yourpart in helping us to continue serving and helping the needy till the Day of Judgment. </p>
